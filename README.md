# Movie Guessing Game (Bollywood - Hollywood)

_This is a game that we used to play in our rough copy with our friends in which either one guess a movie name and put spaces on non-vowel words and the other guesses that movie. He/She guesses one character at a time other than vowels, and if that character is not there in that movie then the other player deletes the first character of Bollywood/Hollywood and so on. And if the player makes it to the end then that player wins by the remaining character in Bollywood/Hollywood otherwise he lose._
